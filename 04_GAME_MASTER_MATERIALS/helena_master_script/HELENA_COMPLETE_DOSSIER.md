# PART 1: THE WOMAN

## 📖 HELENA'S BIOGRAPHY

### **Birth to Age 20 (1898-1918)**

**Full Name:** Helena Maria Whitmore  
**Born:** March 15, 1898, Boston, Massachusetts  
**Family:**
- **Father:** Richard Whitmore (banker, died 1910 when Helena was 12)
- **Mother:** Catherine Whitmore (died 1915 when Helena was 17)
- **Grandmother:** Evelyn Whitmore (wealthy, died 1925 - LEFT HELENA $80,000 she never knew about)

**Childhood:**
- Upper-middle class comfort (not rich, but comfortable)
- Father's death (1910) = family financial decline
- Mother struggled, took in sewing work
- Helena became "helper" - learned to be invisible, useful, NEEDED

**Adolescence (12-17):**
- Smart but never encouraged (girls don't need education)
- Learned to read people (survival skill)
- Watched mother fade from exhaustion
- Mother's death (1915, Helena 17) = alone in world

**Ages 18-20 (1916-1918):**
- No inheritance (father's debts consumed estate)
- Worked as seamstress, then shop girl
- **Didn't know:** Grandmother Evelyn was WEALTHY
- **Didn't know:** When Evelyn died (1925), left Helena EVERYTHING ($80,000)
- Reggie INTERCEPTED the inheritance documents, HID them

---

### **The Trap: Becoming Mrs. Ashford (1922, age 24)**

**How They Met:**

Helena was working as **governess** for the Vanderbilt family (teaching children).

Reggie Ashford attended a society party at the Vanderbilts (1921).

Saw Helena: young, beautiful, POOR, vulnerable.

**Reggie's Strategy (Predator Playbook):**

1. **Phase 1 - The Rescue:**
   - Noticed her mending her own dress (couldn't afford new)
   - Offered "help finding better position"
   - Gifts: gloves, scarf, small things (she felt grateful)

2. **Phase 2 - The Romance:**
   - Courted her (flowers, dinners at modest restaurants)
   - Presented himself as "lonely widower" (Eleanor died 1923)
   - **The Proposal:** "Let me take care of you. You'll never want for anything."
   - Helena (24, alone, exhausted): Said yes

3. **Phase 3 - The Cage:**
   - Married June 1922
   - IMMEDIATELY: "You don't need to work anymore, darling."
   - Pre-nuptial agreement (she signed, didn't understand legal terms)
   - Reality: **If she left = $0. Everything was HIS.**

---

### **The Marriage: 4 Years of Hell (1922-1926)**

#### **PUBLIC PERSONA:**

Helena Ashford = "The Lucky One"

Society saw:
- Poor girl saved by wealthy man (Cinderella story!)
- Grateful wife who adores husband
- Elegant hostess, perfect manners
- "She doesn't understand business" (plays dumb, Reggie likes it)

**Helena's Performance (in public):**
- Laughs at his jokes (even when they humiliate her)
- "Oh darling, you're so clever!" (he's actually mediocre)
- Touches his arm adoringly
- Perfect posture, smile, grace

---

#### **PRIVATE REALITY:**

**Financial Control:**
- No bank account in her name
- $20/week "allowance" for personal items
- Must justify EVERY purchase
- If he's angry: allowance withheld

**Social Control:**
- No friends without his approval ("That woman is beneath you")
- Can't leave house without telling him where/when/who with
- Must be home by specific times
- If late: interrogation, accusations

**Emotional Abuse:**
- Constant belittling: "You're lucky I married you. Who else would?"
- Public praise, private cruelty
- "Don't embarrass me with your opinions."
- Gaslighting: "I never said that. You're imagining things."

**Sexual Control:**
- She's his "property"
- Her consent doesn't matter
- She learned to "go away" mentally during

**The Performance She Perfected:**
- Be dumb (threaten his ego? punishment)
- Be grateful (always)
- Be beautiful (but not too beautiful - other men noticing = jealousy)
- Be INVISIBLE (safest state)

---

#### **INTERNAL HELENA (What No One Saw):**

**What She Actually Is:**
- **Intelligent** (hides this constantly)
- **Strategic** (survival required planning)
- **Observant** (reads people perfectly)
- **Desperate** (dying inside slowly)

**Coping Mechanisms:**
- Dissociation ("I am not here, this is not happening")
- Small rebellions (rearranging his desk items, wearing shoes he dislikes when alone)
- Fantasy (imagining his death - hit by carriage, heart attack, anything)
- Numbness (easier than feeling)

**By Late 1926:**
- Suicidal thoughts (occasional - "what if I just... walked into traffic?")
- But cowardice? Or survival instinct? Unclear.
- Felt dead already

**Then:** James Harrods walked into her life.

---

### **THE AWAKENING: James Harrods (December 1925)**

#### **First Meeting (December 1, 1925 - Business Dinner)**

**The Moment:**

Gatsby Rose Manor. Reggie hosting investors.

Helena (hostess mode): Serving drinks, invisible, smiling.

**James Harrods** (40, banker) + wife Emilia attend.

**Their eyes met across the room.**

**What Helena Felt:**
- Electricity (cliché but TRUE)
- SEEN (for first time in 4 years, someone SAW her)
- Danger (this feeling = dangerous)

**What James Felt:**
- Same (we learn this later)

**They exchanged maybe 10 words that night.**

Helena, alone in bed later: *"Stop thinking about him. Stop. STOP."*

(She couldn't stop.)

---

#### **Second Meeting (December 3, 1925 - Charity Gala)**

Reggie didn't attend (business trip).

Helena went alone (required - Ashford family must represent).

**James was there.**

**What Happened:**

**Terrace, 9pm, cold night.**

Helena escaping crowded ballroom (overwhelmed).

James followed.

**Conversation:**

James: *"Mrs. Ashford. You left your champagne inside."*

Helena: *"I don't drink much. Makes me careless."*

James: *"And you can't afford carelessness."*

*[She looked at him - he KNEW. Somehow knew.]*

Helena: *"Mr. Harrods... your wife is looking for you."*

James: *"I know."*

*[Silence. Traffic sounds below. December wind.]*

James: *"I haven't stopped thinking about you."*

Helena: *"Don't."*

James: *"I can't help it."*

Helena (trembling): *"I... we can't..."*

**He kissed her.**

**She kissed back.**

**3 seconds. Eternity.**

Helena pulled away: *"This can't happen."*

James: *"It already did."*

---

#### **The Affair (December 1925 - December 1926)**

**Frequency:** 2-3 meetings per week

**Locations:**
- Hotels (false names: "Mr. and Mrs. Silva")
- Small apartment James rented (Brooklyn, discreet)
- Never anywhere they'd be recognized

**What They Did:**
- Yes, physical (obviously)
- But MORE: **TALKED**

**For the First Time in 4 Years:**
- Helena spoke her mind
- Helena laughed REAL laugh
- Helena felt INTELLIGENT (James asked her opinions, LISTENED)
- Helena felt ALIVE

**James Gave Her:**
- Respect (revolutionary)
- Genuine interest (asked about her thoughts, dreams, past)
- Safety to be HERSELF (no performance needed)

**What Helena Felt:**
- Love (genuine, devastating, first time ever)
- Terror (if Reggie found out = destroyed)
- Alive (after 4 years walking dead)
- DESPERATE (couldn't live without this now)

---

#### **The Letters:**

They wrote letters (dangerous but couldn't help).

**Helena's letters:**
- Hidden in coat lining
- Destroyed after reading (mostly)
- But kept 2 (couldn't bear destroying)
- Those 2 letters = FOUND later (evidence)

**Content (example from her to James, Nov 1926):**

> *"My darling,*
>
> *I exist in two worlds now. In one, I am his wife - silent, grateful, small. In the other, I am YOURS - loud, ungrateful for what I had, enormous with want.*
>
> *I cannot keep living in both. Something must break.*
>
> *When I am with you, I forget I was ever dead. When I return to him, I remember I still am.*
>
> *What do we do with a love that has nowhere to live?*
>
> *H."*

James kept this letter. Police found it later (evidence).

---

#### **The Fantasy: Paris**

They talked about running away.

**The Plan (naive, impossible):**
- Wait until Helena inherits (she DIDN'T KNOW she already had $80k waiting!)
- James divorces Emilia (he tried to convince himself this was possible)
- Leave America
- Paris - city of new starts
- "After we're free... Paris."

**Why It Was Impossible:**

**For James:**
- Divorce = social suicide (especially for banker)
- Lose children (custody goes to mother)
- Lose career (scandal)

**For Helena:**
- No money of her own (pre-nup)
- Reggie would hunt her down (ego)
- Where would she go?

**But They Kept Dreaming:**

Because the alternative was unbearable: NOT being together.

---

#### **HELENA'S INTERNAL CONFLICT (Dec 1925 - Dec 1926)**

**Guilt (Minimal):**
- Toward Reggie? ZERO (he deserved this)
- Toward Emilia? YES (innocent victim, mother)
- Toward self? Complex

**Fear (Massive):**
- Discovery = loss of James
- Discovery = potentially physical danger from Reggie
- Discovery = financial ruin

**Desire (Overwhelming):**
- Be with James forever
- Be FREE
- Be HERSELF without performance

**The Impossible Math:**
- Can't leave Reggie (no money, nowhere to go)
- Can't stop seeing James (only thing keeping her alive)
- Can't continue like this (unsustainable)

**Something had to break.**

---

### **THE BREAKING POINT (December 19-20, 1926)**

#### **December 19, 1926: James Calls (Night)**

**Phone call, James voice shaking:**

James: *"Helena. I need to see you. Tonight. Emergency."*

Helena (Reggie in next room): *"I... I can't. He's here."*

James: *"Tomorrow. 10am. The Brooklyn apartment. Please."*

Helena: *"What's wrong?"*

James: *"Everything. Everything is wrong."*

---

#### **December 20, 1926: The Decision (10am, Brooklyn Apartment)**

**Helena Arrives:**

James pacing, hasn't slept, looks ILL.

Helena: *"What happened?"*

**James Tells Her:**

James: *"Reggie knows. About the stocks. The fraud. He's going to denounce me. Monday, December 26th. His lawyer is ready."*

Helena (pale): *"How much?"*

James: *"$15,000. Ten years prison. Minimum."*

Helena: *"Oh God. Oh my God."*

James: *"I lose everything. Career. Freedom. YOU."*

**Silence. Traffic outside. Clock ticking.**

Helena (whisper): *"He knows about us too."*

James (looks up): *"What?"*

Helena: *"Private detective. He's been having me followed. I saw the reports on his desk yesterday."*

James: *"So he's going to..."*

Helena: *"Divorce me. With nothing. I get nothing."*

**They sat there. Two people watching their lives end.**

---

**Who Said It First?**

Unclear. Both thought it. One said it aloud.

*"What if... he wasn't alive to do it?"*

---

**The Conversation That Followed (Approximate):**

James: *"You mean..."*

Helena: *"I can't live without you. And I can't go back to him. I CAN'T."*

James: *"If we're caught..."*

Helena: *"We won't be."*

James: *"People will suspect..."*

Helena: *"They always suspect the spouse. And the business partner with motive. We KNOW they'll suspect us. So we plan for that."*

*[She was thinking clearly - FIRST time in 4 years her intelligence had space to operate]*

James: *"How would we even..."*

Helena: *"I've thought about this. For months. Not seriously, just... fantasy. But I know how."*

James: *"Tell me."*

---

**Helena's Plan (Delivered Calmly, Coldly):**

> *"Christmas party. Everyone there. Chaos, drinking, music.*
>
> *I take him to the office. Say I have surprise.*
>
> *You're already there. Hidden.*
>
> *We kill him. Together. Fast.*
>
> *Then we stage it. Make it look like someone else. During Daisy's performance - everyone distracted.*
>
> *I 'discover' the body. Scream. Grief.*
>
> *They investigate. They suspect everyone. Including us.*
>
> *But they can't PROVE. Not if we're careful.*
>
> *And then... Paris."*

---

**James' Response:**

Not "No."

Not "This is insane."

Just: *"When?"*

Helena: *"December 24th. Four days."*

---

**Why They Both Said Yes:**

**James:**
- Prison = lose everything anyway
- Already lost (no other option)
- Loved her (desperately)

**Helena:**
- Four years of death
- Finally ALIVE with James
- "Better to burn than freeze" (better prison with clear conscience than cage with Reggie)

**Both:**
- Believed they had NO OTHER CHOICE
- (They were wrong - Helena's inheritance existed - but they DIDN'T KNOW)

---

#### **December 20-23: The Preparation**

**What They Did:**

**December 21:**
- James acquired piano wire (asked Filipp Moretti - "gift for jazz band")
- Practiced grip at apartment (rope on pillow)
- Timed how long strangulation takes (research - 30-60 seconds)

**December 22:**
- Full rehearsal
- Helena practiced "discovery" scream
- Discussed contingencies (what if caught mid-act? what if body discovered too soon?)

**December 23:**
- Final meeting
- Both terrified
- Both committed

**Helena's Final Words Before Leaving (Dec 23, midnight):**

> *"Promise me. If we're caught. If they discover. We say NOTHING. We protect each other. Together until the end."*

James: *"Together. Always."*

*[They kissed. Both knew it might be last time as free people.]*

---

**December 24, 1926: Morning**

Helena woke up.

Reggie beside her (sleeping).

Thought: *"Tonight, you die."*

Felt: Nothing. Numb.

Got up. Prepared for party.

**By 7pm (guests arriving):**

Helena in emerald dress. Hair perfect. Smile perfect.

**Inside:**

Adrenaline. Terror. Calm.

"I can do this. I can do this. I can do this."

# PART 2: THE CRIME

## 🔪 THE MURDER - HELENA'S PERSPECTIVE

### **20h00-20h09: Before (The Waiting)**

**What Helena Was Doing:**

- Hostess mode: Greeting guests, smiling, offering drinks
- Watching clock: 20h09 = time to act
- Seeing James across room: Eye contact (silent communication: "Ready?")
- Monitoring Reggie (Ricardo playing him): Jovial, arrogant, planting conflicts with guests

**What Helena Was Thinking:**

*"He's enjoying himself. Making people uncomfortable. Of course he is. Last time he gets to."*

**What Helena Was Feeling:**

- Detached (like watching herself from outside)
- Calm (eerily calm - dissociation or determination?)
- Moment of doubt at 20h08: *"We could still stop. Walk away. Just... leave."*
- Then Reggie laughed (cruel laugh at someone's expense)
- Doubt vanished: *"No. This ends tonight."*

---

### **20h09: THE TRAP**

**Helena Approaches Reggie:**

Helena (sweet voice, public): *"Darling, can you come with me a moment? I have your surprise in the office."*

Reggie (Ricardo): *"Oh? Can't it wait?"*

Helena (playful): *"It's time-sensitive."* [double meaning - James waiting]

Reggie: *"Alright, alright."* [to guests] *"Excuse me, duty calls!"*

**What Helena Felt Walking to Office:**

- Legs: heavy, mechanical
- Heart: pounding (guests can see? no, smile hides it)
- Mind: *"This is it. No turning back. James is behind that door. In 5 minutes, Reggie is dead."*

**Guests didn't notice anything unusual.**

---

### **20h10: ENTERING THE OFFICE**

**Door closes behind them.**

Office: mahogany desk, leather sofa, bookshelves, curtain drawn.

Reggie: *"So where's this surprise?"*

Helena (voice slightly shaking): *"Right... here."*

*[She looked toward the curtain]*

---

**James stepped out.**

---

**Reggie (confused):** *"James? What—"*

**NO MORE WORDS.**

---

### **20h11:00 - 20h11:40: THE MURDER (40 seconds - Helena's Experience)**

#### **Second 0-3: The Attack**

Both moved simultaneously.

James: Piano wire ready, crossed behind Reggie's neck.

Helena: Grabbed other end, pulled TIGHT.

**What Helena Felt:**
- Wire cutting her glove (later realized - fingerprint issue)
- Reggie's body jerking backward against her
- Strength required (MORE than expected - he's fighting HARD)

---

#### **Second 4-10: The Struggle**

Reggie: Gasping (no air for scream), clawing at wire, cutting his own fingers (blood on wire).

James: Grunting, pulling harder.

Helena: *"Don't let go. Don't let go. DON'T LET GO."*

**What Helena Heard:**
- Reggie's gasps (horrible, drowning-on-land sound)
- His feet kicking desk (THUD - loud! but jazz music outside muffled it)
- Her own breathing (ragged)

**What Helena Thought:**
- *"He's dying. We're killing him. I'm killing him. Oh God oh God oh God—"*
- Then: *"Good. DIE. You deserve this."*

---

#### **Second 11-20: The Weakening**

Reggie's struggles: slowing.

Body: still twitching but less violent.

James: *"Almost... almost..."*

**What Helena Noticed:**
- Reggie's eyes (bulging, bloodshot, looking at HER - did he know? did he understand it was HER?)
- Smell (sweat, fear, something else - death?)
- Her own hands (shaking but HOLDING - she didn't let go)

---

#### **Second 21-35: The Dying**

Reggie: Spasms, less coordinated.

Helena: *"How long does this TAKE?!"*

James: *"Keep pulling!"*

**What Helena Felt:**
- Exhaustion (physical - arms burning)
- Nausea (this is real, this is REAL)
- Determination (can't stop now)

---

#### **Second 36-40: The End**

Reggie's body: went STILL.

Eyes: open, staring at nothing.

**Silence.**

---

**Helena let go of the wire.**

Stepped back.

**Looked at James.**

**Looked at body.**

---

### **20h11:40 - 20h14: IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH (2min 20sec of Horror)**

**Both stared at body.**

**James (whisper):** *"Oh God. Oh God. We... we did it."*

**Helena:** Couldn't speak. Trembling. Hands shaking uncontrollably.

**James:** *"I can't... I can't breathe..."*

**Helena (suddenly SHARP, survival mode):** *"Stop. STOP. We planned this. We have to... the staging."*

---

**What Helena Noticed:**

- Blood on her gloves (Reggie's finger cuts from wire)
- Blood on James's coat sleeve
- Reggie's eyes (still open - she reached down, closed them - couldn't bear stare)
- Her own face in desk mirror: pale, sweating, pupils HUGE

---

**Quick Cleanup:**

Helena: Removed gloves (bloodstained), stuffed in desk drawer (FORGOT to retrieve later = CLUE found).

James: Wiped wire on handkerchief, ready to hide it.

Both: Attempted to wipe blood from carpet (left faint stain = CLUE).

**Helena (checking clock):** *"20h13. Daisy's second song should start any moment. That's our window."*

**James:** *"How are you so CALM?!"*

**Helena:** *"I'm not."* [her hands were shaking] *"But we don't have time to fall apart."*

---

### **20h14-20h15: THE WAITING**

**Both in office, with corpse.**

**Listening:**

- Muffled conversation from ballroom
- Someone laughs (surreal - life continuing while they stand over body)
- Glass clinks
- Jazz music soft background

**Helena (staring at Reggie):** *"How can they not know? How can they just... keep talking?"*

**James:** *"Because we're good liars."*

**Helena:** *"We're murderers."*

**James:** *"Yes."*

---

**Then: From ballroom:**

> Daisy (announcing): *"For my next number... 'My Funny Valentine'..."*

**Music begins.**

**Helena (urgent whisper):** *"NOW."*

---

### **20h15-20h16: MOVING THE BODY (60 seconds of Desperation)**

#### **Step 1: Lift (15 seconds)**

James + Helena: Lift body (HEAVY - Reggie 85kg deadweight).

Helena: Grabbed legs, James grabbed shoulders.

**What Helena Thought:**
*"He's so heavy. Why is he so HEAVY? Move. MOVE."*

---

#### **Step 2: Drag to Door (15 seconds)**

Awkward, stumbling, nearly dropped him.

Helena's dress: caught on his shoe (had to yank free).

Office door: Helena opened carefully, checked hallway.

**Clear** (everyone watching Daisy).

---

#### **Step 3: Hallway to Ballroom (30 seconds - RISKIEST)**

Dragged body down hallway.

Helena: Constant checking (anyone coming? NO. Keep going.)

**What Helena Felt:**
- Pure terror (if someone walks out RIGHT NOW = caught, prison, everything over)
- Adrenaline (moving FAST)
- Surreal (this is insane, this is INSANE)

---

#### **Step 4: Punch Bowl (20 seconds)**

Large crystal bowl on table (8L capacity, filled with Silver Fox Punch).

James + Helena: LIFTED body (both straining), placed HEAD-FIRST into punch.

**Sound:** SPLASH (loud! but Daisy singing covered it).

**What Helena Saw:**
- Reggie's head submerged
- Punch turning PINK (blood mixing)
- His legs hanging over bowl edge (grotesque)

---

#### **Step 5: The Star (10 seconds)**

Helena: Grabbed Christmas tree star from tree.

James: Held Reggie's head steady.

Helena: JAMMED star into his head (made CRACK sound - hoped music covered).

**What Helena Felt Jamming Star:**
- Resistance (skull harder than expected)
- Crunch (nauseating)
- Primal horror (we're DESECRATING a corpse)

---

**20h16:30 - Done.**

**They separated:**
- James: Slipped back to guest area, applauded song from back of room (tried to look normal).
- Helena: Returned to office briefly.

---

### **20h16:30 - 20h17:30: FINAL STAGING (Helena Alone)**

**In office:**

Helena: Wiped more blood traces (shaking hands).

Adjusted furniture (make it look undisturbed).

**Checked appearance in mirror:**
- Hair: messed up (fix it)
- Dress: bloodstain on hem (PANIC - rolled hem up, hoped no one noticed)
- Face: PALE, sweating (reapply powder, lipstick with SHAKING hands)
- Eyes: wild (breathe, BREATHE, calm down)

**Changed gloves AGAIN** (third pair tonight - had spares, thank God).

**Practiced in mirror:**
- *"Reggie? Darling, where... REGGIE!"* [too fake]
- *[Gasps] "No... no no no..."* [better]

---

### **20h17:30 - 20h18: THE "DISCOVERY"**

**Daisy's song ENDING.**

**Applause.**

**Helena:** Walked toward ballroom (measured pace, not running - DON'T look suspicious).

**Entered.**

**Scanned room.**

**Saw punch bowl.**

**PAUSED.**

*[2 seconds of "processing" - acting]*

---

## **"REEEEGGIIIEEE!!!"**

---

**THE SCREAM.**

- Piercing
- Genuine-sounding (channeled real fear/adrenaline)
- Cut through applause like knife

**ALL GUESTS TURNED.**

**Saw:**
- Body in punch bowl
- Star in head
- Blood + punch (grotesque pink)

**Helena (RUNNING to bowl):** *"NO! NO! SOMEONE HELP!"*

**Chaos erupted.**

---

### **HELENA'S PERFORMANCE (20h18-20h25)**

**What Helena Did:**

- Collapsed near bowl (caught by JC Mendes)
- Sobbing (real tears - adrenaline, horror, relief, fear - ALL real)
- *"Who would... why would... my husband..."*
- Let JC lead her away from body

**What Helena Thought:**

*"Did I do that right? Was the scream good? Are they convinced? Don't overact. Genuine grief. GENUINE."*

**What Helena Felt:**

- Relief (it's done, no turning back now)
- Terror (investigation starts NOW)
- Exhaustion (adrenaline crash beginning)
- Guilt (Emilia's face - innocent, horrified - oh God, what have we DONE to her?)

---

---

# PART 3: THE PERFORMANCE

## 🎭 HOW TO PLAY HELENA CONVINCINGLY

### **THE CHALLENGE:**

You (Helena player) must simultaneously be:

1. **Helena the Character** (shocked widow)
2. **Helena the Killer** (hiding guilt)
3. **Helena the GM** (distributing clues, managing game)

This section teaches you how to LAYER these convincingly.

---

## 🎬 ACTING TECHNIQUE: THE THREE HELENAS

### **LAYER 1: SURFACE (What Everyone Sees)**

**"The Grieving Widow"**

**Characteristics:**
- Shocked, devastated
- Can't believe "someone would do this"
- Trusts investigators (especially JC)
- Helpful but fragile

**Physical Performance:**
- Trembling hands (occasionally)
- Dabbing eyes with handkerchief
- Sitting down suddenly (overcome)
- Voice: breaks on certain words ("husband," "killed")

**Dialogue Style:**
- "I don't understand..."
- "Who could have...?"
- "We were so happy..." (LIE, but she sells it)

---

### **LAYER 2: BENEATH (Micro-Expressions of Guilt)**

**"The Woman Holding Secrets"**

These are TINY cracks in the facade. Players should notice IF they're watching carefully.

**Micro-Tells (Do These Subtly):**
- Looking at James TOO long, then catching yourself (whoops)
- Flinching when someone mentions "office" (crime scene)
- Hand going to throat when "strangulation" mentioned (unconscious)
- Avoiding Emilia's eyes (guilt)

**When To Show These:**
- Acts I-III: Rarely (you're GOOD at hiding)
- Act IV: More frequently (pressure building, harder to maintain)

**Purpose:**
Good players notice these and think "She's suspicious." That's CORRECT. You WANT suspicion. Just not PROOF.

---

### **LAYER 3: CORE (Your Truth - Keep HIDDEN)**

**"The Killer Who Believes She Had No Choice"**

This is what you're ACTUALLY feeling. Never show directly, but it informs everything.

**Internal Monologue (What Helena Really Thinks):**
- "I had to. There was no other way."
- "He deserved this." (mixed with) "But did Emilia deserve THIS?" (guilt)
- "James and I... we did this together. Protect him."
- "If they find out... prison. But at least I'll have LIVED first."

**Complex Emotions:**
- Love for James (desperate, real)
- Relief Reggie's dead (guilty about relief)
- Terror of discovery (constant)
- Grief for Emilia (genuine - you destroyed her)

---

## 🎭 ACT-BY-ACT PERFORMANCE GUIDE

### **ACT I: THE HOSTESS (20h00-20h09)**

**Your Role:** Perfect hostess, slight nervousness (normal party jitters).

**Objectives:**
- Greet all guests warmly
- Set tone (elegant, festive)
- Plant tiny seeds of Reggie's unpleasantness (guests should think "he's kind of a jerk")

**Key Moments:**

**Greeting JC (first arrival):**
> Helena: *"Mr. Mendes! So glad you could come. Reggie's just finishing up some work, he'll join us shortly."*  
> [Warm smile, slight nervousness - hosting is stressful!]

**When James + Emilia arrive:**
> Helena: *"James, Emilia, wonderful to see you both."*  
> [Be CAREFUL here - greet BOTH equally, don't linger on James, don't avoid Emilia]  
> [But allow yourself ONE micro-glance at James - brief, then away]

**When Daisy arrives:**
> Helena: *"Daisy, darling! Thank you so much for performing tonight."*  
> [Slight tension - Daisy was Reggie's mistress, you "don't know" but might suspect]

**Managing Reggie (Ricardo):**
> If he says something cruel to guest:  
> Helena: *"Oh darling, I'm sure they didn't mean it that way..."* [smoothing over, apologetic]

**20h05: During Daisy's First Song:**
- Stand near back, enjoy music (genuinely - last moments of "before")
- Applaud warmly after

**20h08: Final Moments Before:**
- Check clock (casually)
- Locate James with eyes (he's ready? yes? ok)
- Deep breath
- Approach Reggie...

---

### **ACT II: THE DISCOVERY (20h09-20h30)**

**Your Role:** Shocked widow discovering murdered husband.

**20h09-20h17: You're "offstage" (office, doing murder)**

**20h18: THE SCREAM**

**HOW TO SCREAM EFFECTIVELY:**

**DO:**
- Full lung capacity, from diaphragm
- High-pitched, sharp (cuts through noise)
- Genuine shock (channel real adrenaline you're feeling)
- Cut off slightly (like breath caught)

**DON'T:**
- Theatrical "movie scream" (too fake)
- Laugh-screaming (nervous laughter = sus)
- Too quiet (no one hears = no discovery)

**PRACTICE THIS BEFOREHAND** (seriously, in car or somewhere you can scream).

---

**20h18-20h25: Immediate Aftermath**

**Your Actions:**
1. Run toward bowl (but don't touch body)
2. Let JC or someone catch/steady you
3. Sob (genuine tears if possible - think about something sad, or just adrenaline will do it)
4. *"No... no... who would... SOMEONE HELP!"*

**What You're Actually Feeling:**
- Relief (it's done)
- Terror (investigation starts)
- Exhaustion (adrenaline crash)

**Channel this into:**
- Shaking
- Needing to sit down
- Can't look at body

---

**20h25-20h30: JC Takes Charge**

**Your Role:** Defer to him (you're "too upset" to lead).

JC: *"Nobody leaves. We need to establish who was where."*

Helena: *"Yes... yes of course... whatever you need..."* [dazed]

**But also (GM mode):** Start preparing Tier 1 envelopes (you have them ready, hidden).

---

**20h30: Distribution of Tier 1 Clues**

**Your Role:** Shift slightly from "devastated widow" to "trying to help."

Helena: *"The police will want to know everything. I... I found these earlier. Maybe they're relevant?"*

[Distribute 9 envelopes to specific people]

**Delivery Style:**
- Somber, formal
- Hand each envelope personally
- Brief eye contact (except avoid lingering on James - that's suspicious)

**To Emilia specifically:**
Helena: *"Cristina... I'm so sorry you have to see this..."* [genuine guilt here - you're about to destroy her life]

---

### **ACT III: THE INVESTIGATION (20h30-21h45)**

**Your Role:** Helpful but fragile widow, hiding MASSIVE guilt.

**Primary Objectives:**
1. Seem cooperative (but not TOO eager)
2. Deflect suspicion toward Daisy when possible (she HAD affair = obvious suspect)
3. Resist opening office initially (don't want them finding evidence you missed)
4. Manage clue distribution (GM role)

---

**DEFENSE STRATEGIES (If Accused):**

#### **If Someone Mentions Inheritance:**

Player: *"Helena, you inherit everything now, don't you?"*

Helena: *"I... I suppose so, but we've been married fifteen years. Every couple has life insurance. You can't think I'd—"* [pause, hurt] *"How DARE you."*

[Note: Actually married 4 years, but you lie reflexively]

---

#### **If Someone Finds Divorce Letter (Your Tier 1 Clue):**

Player: *"This says Reggie wanted to divorce you!"*

Helena: *"What?! Let me see that..."* [read, genuine shock - you DIDN'T know about this letter] *"I... I had no idea. He never said..."* [starting to cry] *"You think I killed him because of THIS? I would have LET him divorce me if that's what he wanted!"* [lie, but convincing]

---

#### **If Pressed About Marriage Quality:**

Player: *"Were you happy together?"*

Helena: *"Of course we were. He could be... difficult sometimes. Strong personality. But I loved him."* [she's VERY good at this lie - 4 years practice]

---

#### **If Someone Mentions Office (Crime Scene):**

Player: *"What were you doing in the office earlier?"*

Helena: *"I... I was showing him his Christmas present. It was in there."* [true!] *"But when we went in, he seemed fine, and then I left to check on guests and..."* [stops, as if remembering] *"Wait. Did someone go in AFTER me?"*

[Good deflection - plants idea of "someone else"]

---

#### **If They Find Handkerchief "H+J" (Tier 2 Clue - DAMNING):**

**This is DANGEROUS. You need GOOD deflection.**

Player: *"This handkerchief has 'H+J' embroidered on it. Helena and... James?"*

Helena: [quick thinking] *"That's... that's not mine. I don't embroider my handkerchiefs."* [true - Reggie bought yours] *"H could be anyone. Helen? Harriet? And J could be John, Joseph... You're REACHING."*

[Weak deflection, but plants doubt]

---

#### **If Mordomo (Ricardo) Testifies You Led Reggie to Office:**

**This is VERY dangerous. You need emotional defense.**

Helena: [standing, voice shaking] *"Yes! I LED him to the office! I was showing him his GIFT! He was my HUSBAND! Why would I hurt him?!"* [tears starting] *"You're all looking at me like I'm... like I'm some kind of monster!"*

[Sit down heavily, cover face]

Helena: *"I loved him. You have to believe me."* [look at JC specifically - he's moral compass] *"Please."*

**What You're Banking On:**
- Emotional appeal works (people uncomfortable accusing sobbing widow)
- "Led him there" ≠ proof of murder (someone ELSE could've entered after)

---

### **ACT IV: CONFRONTATION (21h45-22h50)**

**Your Role:** Pressure MAXIMUM, harder to maintain innocence.

**Tier 3 Clues Coming:**
- Mordomo testimony (damning)
- Forensic analysis (not drowning, TWO attackers)
- Ledger (James motive + your affair documented)

**Expect: You'll be in TOP 3 suspects by voting.**

---

**WHEN IN TOP 3:**

#### **Your Final Defense Speech (If Required):**

Helena: [stands, trembling but FIERCE]

> *"You want to know the TRUTH?*
>
> *Yes, I took him to the office. Yes, I was showing him a gift. And yes, he was ALIVE when I left him there.*
>
> *You think I killed him for MONEY?"* [voice rising] *"I've lived with that man for FIFTEEN YEARS!"* [lie - 4 years, but pressure makes you defensive]
>
> *"Every single day, I woke up next to him. Made his breakfast. Hosted his parties. Smiled at his jokes."*
>
> *"And you think I'd throw that all away? For WHAT? An inheritance I didn't even know about?"* [this is actually TRUE - you didn't know about $80k]
>
> *"Someone else killed him. Someone who hated him."* [look around room] *"And God knows there were PLENTY of people who hated him."*
>
> *"But it wasn't me."*

[Sit down, put face in hands]

Helena: [quietly] *"It wasn't me."* [lie, but she's VERY convincing]

---

**IF JAMES CONFESSES FIRST:**

**This Changes Everything.**

James: *"I did it. We both did. She didn't force me. I chose this."*

**Your Options:**

**OPTION A: Continue Denying (Protect Yourself):**

Helena: [shocked] *"WHAT?! James, what are you SAYING?!"*

James: *"Helena, stop—"*

Helena: *"You're trying to drag me into this because of some... some FANTASY you had about us?!"* [harsh, desperate]

[This is UGLY but might work - throw him under bus, save yourself]

---

**OPTION B: Confess Together (Honest):**

Helena: [long pause, then quiet] *"He's right."*

[Everyone stares]

Helena: *"We did it. Both of us."*

[Stands, looks at Emilia's empty chair - she left/suicided earlier]

Helena: *"And Cristina is dead because of us."*

[Voice breaking] *"So yes. We killed him. And we killed her too, in a way."*

---

### **EMILIA'S SUICIDE (22h30-22h45) - CRITICAL GM MOMENT**

**This is When You Might Break Character (Briefly):**

**What Happens:**

Emilia (Cris) discovers affair during Act IV accusations.

Realizes: Husband killed for OTHER WOMAN.

Walks to conservatory (players notice or don't).

Leaves suicide note (you planted it earlier).

**Exits** (Cris player steps out of character, becomes observer).

---

**Your Role (Helena):**

**AS CHARACTER:** Didn't see her leave (you were being accused, distracted).

**AS GM:** Need to prompt discovery.

---

**~3 Minutes After Emilia Exits:**

Helena: [as GM, breaking tension slightly] *"Wait... where's Cristina?"*

[Everyone looks around]

Player: *"She left?"*

Helena: *"Someone should check on her... she was upset..."*

[Volunteer or you go]

**Discovery:**

[Return with NOTE, face pale]

Helena: [AS CHARACTER, reading] *"Oh my God. She's... she's gone. She left this."*

[Read note ALOUD - Cris wrote it, has text]

---

**After Note Is Read:**

**AS CHARACTER (Helena guilt is REAL here):**

Helena: [genuine tears] *"Cristina... no... no no no..."*

[This is REAL guilt - you destroyed her, she's dead because of your choices]

**AS GM:**

Allow brief moment of processing (this is HEAVY), then:

Helena: [quietly] *"The game... continues. She wanted us to solve it."*

[Acknowledge Cris (player) can stay as observer or take break]

---

### **ACT V: REVELATION (23h00-23h30)**

**Your Role:** Confess (or be revealed), then NARRATE as GM.

**23h00-23h05: The Confession**

If not already confessed, you do now (voting reveals you + James).

Helena: [drops performance, stays in character but HONEST]

> *"Yes. We did it.*
>
> *Together. Planned it. Executed it.*
>
> *You want to know WHY?"*
>
> [Looks around room]
>
> *"Four years. Four years I lived with him. You saw the surface - elegant parties, expensive dresses, 'grateful rescued governess.'"*
>
> *"You didn't see the rest."*
>
> *"You didn't see him control every dollar. Every friend. Every BREATH."*
>
> *"You didn't see how he made me feel small. Stupid. OWNED."*
>
> *"And then I met James."* [looks at him] *"And for the first time in four years... I felt alive."*
>
> *"So yes. We killed him. For love. For freedom."*
>
> *"Was it worth it?"*
>
> [Looks at empty chair where Emilia sat]
>
> *"Ask me that again."*

---

**23h05-23h15: The Reconstruction (GM MODE - Fully)**

**Now You Narrate Everything:**

1. **Timeline** (20h09-20h18, minute by minute)
2. **Method** (strangulation, staging)
3. **Show the 6 TRUE clues:**
   - Piano wire
   - Strangulation marks
   - Handkerchief H+J
   - Mordomo testimony
   - Ledger
   - Button

4. **Explain Motive:**
   - James: Fraud = prison
   - Helena: Abuse + love
   - Both: Desperate

5. **Why It Seemed Like Drowning:**
   - Misdirection (star in head, punch bowl)
   - Create suspects (anyone could push into punch)

---

**23h20-23h25: THE TWIST - Reggie's Letter**

**Your Best Acting Moment:**

Helena: [as GM] *"But wait. There's one more thing."*

[Produce sealed envelope from desk]

Helena: [as GM] *"I found this earlier. It says... 'Open only if I die under suspicious circumstances.'"*

[Open, read ALOUD - it's Reggie's posthumous letter]

**KEY POINTS IN LETTER:**
- He knew about fraud (had proof)
- He knew about affair (detective)
- He HID Helena's $80k inheritance (grandmother Whitmore)
- If Helena had known = could've divorced, been rich, NO MURDER NEEDED
- Crime was COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE
- Money goes to Inês + Denise (his abandoned daughters inherit everything)
- Ultimate karma: the children he rejected become wealthy

---

**Helena's Reaction (Character - GENUINE devastation):**

Helena: [while reading, voice starts breaking]

*"...your grandmother Whitmore died 1925... left you $80,000..."*

[Stops reading, looks up]

Helena: *"I... I was an heiress?"*

[Realizing]

Helena: *"I could have... divorced him. Taken the money. Been FREE."*

[Looks at James]

Helena: *"We didn't need to kill him."*

[Looks at Emilia's empty chair]

Helena: *"Cristina died because I didn't know I was RICH."*

[Pause, then quieter]

Helena: *"And now... Inês and Denise inherit everything. The daughters Reggie abandoned."*

[Bitter laugh]

Helena: *"He wins. Even dead, he WINS."*

**This Is REAL Emotion** (even though you're GM - let yourself FEEL this tragedy).

---

**23h25-23h30: Debriefing (GM MODE - Supportive)**

Helena: [stepping fully out of character now]

*"So... that's the story. Greek tragedy level, right?"*

*"Nobody wins. Helena and James go to prison. Emilia's dead. Reggie wins from the grave. The kids are orphans."*

*"Pure karma."*

---

**Then Ask:**
- Who was closest to solving?
- What clues worked/didn't?
- How did everyone feel about their characters?
- **Emotional check-in:** *"That was heavy. Everyone okay?"*

**Certificates/Awards:**
- Best Detective
- Best Performance
- Most Dramatic Accusation
- Most Convincing Liar

**Thank Everyone.**

**Toast** (if appropriate).

## 📦 CLUE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM

### **TIER 1: After Murder (20h30)**

**What:** 9 sealed envelopes, pre-prepared.

**Who Gets What:**

1. **JC Mendes** → Mansion floor plan (investigation tool)
2. **James Harrods** → Stock fraud evidence (incriminates him)
3. **Emilia Harrods** → Generic party invitation (seems innocent)
4. **Daisy Valmont** → Breakup letter from Reggie (motive)
5. **Maria Fletcher** → Newspaper clipping 1923 (her ruined career)
6. **Padre Rui** → Confession log (James said "I will kill")
7. **Filipp Moretti** → Receipt for punch ingredients (red herring)
8. **Ines Beaumont** → Birth certificate (proves daughter)
9. **Denise Beaumont** → Blackmail payment receipts (motive)
10. **YOU (Helena)** → Divorce letter from Reggie (motive)

**How To Distribute:**

Stand, somber:

> *"I... I found these earlier today. The police will want to see everything. Maybe they're relevant."*

Hand each envelope personally. Brief eye contact (except avoid lingering on James).

---

### **TIER 2: Investigation Phase (21h00-21h45)**

**What:** 14 clues hidden around "mansion" (your playing space).

**Your Role:** Players search, YOU reveal when found.

**Zones:**
1. **Ballroom** (body, punch, tree, piano)
2. **Office** (locked initially - you resist opening)
3. **Hallway** (coats, smaller clues)
4. **Conservatory** (séance location)

**Gradual Release:**

**First 20min (21h00-21h20):**
- If player investigates punch: "You notice a lipstick-stained glass near the bowl." (Daisy's - red herring)
- If player investigates office (after you reluctantly open): "Behind the desk, a manuscript with notes..." (Maria's stolen work - red herring)
- If Padre investigates tree: "A rosary tangled in branches, with... is that blood?" (his rosary, fell earlier - red herring)

**Next 20min (21h20-21h40):**
- If player investigates piano: **"Behind the piano, you find... a thin wire. Stained dark."** (MURDER WEAPON - true clue)
- If player investigates office desk: "A letter, torn, threatening..." (Filipp angry about recipe - red herring)
- If player investigates hallway: "An anonymous telegram." (about smuggling - red herring)

**Final 20min (21h40-22h00):**
- If player investigates office sofa: **"A silk handkerchief. Embroidered: H+J."** (Helena + James - TRUE CLUE)
- If player investigates office carpet: **"A faint stain. Recent. Blood?"** (crime scene - TRUE CLUE)
- If player investigates tree again: **"A gray button, caught on a branch."** (James's coat - TRUE CLUE)

**Strategy:**

- TRUE clues: harder to find (require specific searches)
- RED HERRINGS: easier (make everyone seem suspicious)
- Balance: some should find something, but not ALL clues found

---

### **TIER 3: Confrontation (22h00+)**

**What:** 3 decisive clues, revealed BY YOU (GM mode).

**When To Reveal:**

#### **Clue 1: Mordomo Testimony (22h00)**

Ricardo (as Clarence the butler) steps forward:

> *"I must speak. I saw things.*
>
> *20h09: Mrs. Ashford led master to office. Alone.*
>
> *20h17: Mrs. Ashford exited office. Alone. Pale.*
>
> *20h08: I saw Mr. Harrods near office hallway. Waiting."*

**Your Reaction (as Helena):** Panic, deny: *"I left him ALIVE!"*

---

#### **Clue 2: Forensic Analysis (22h10 or when JC requests)**

JC: *"Can I examine the body more closely?"*

You (GM): *"Of course."*

[JC mimes examining]

You (GM, narrating findings): 

> *"The neck has thin ligature marks. Not consistent with drowning.*
>
> *Water in lungs is minimal. He died BEFORE entering the punch.*
>
> *The angle of the marks... suggests TWO different grips. Two attackers."*

**Your Reaction (as Helena):** Visible fear (this is VERY damning).

---

#### **Clue 3: Secret Ledger (22h20 or if players open office safe)**

If players solve safe combination (clue you planted) OR force it open:

You (GM): *"Inside, you find a ledger."*

[Hand them paper with text]

> *Page dated Dec 19, 1926:*
>
> *"J. Harrods - fraud confirmed. $15k. Evidence secured. Arrest Dec 26."*
>
> *Page dated Dec 17, 1926:*
>
> *"H. affair. Detective confirms. J. Harrods. Divorce proceedings."*

**Your Reaction (as Helena):** This is it. You're caught. Deflect or confess (your choice).

---

## 🎲 MANAGING MINI-GAMES

### **SÉANCE (Emilia Leads - 2x During Act III)**

**Setup:**
- Dim lights (if possible)
- Everyone holds hands around table
- Emilia: *"I will attempt to contact Reggie's spirit..."*

**Your Role (GM):**

Whisper cryptic phrases (Emilia repeats as "Reggie's voice"):

**Phrases To Use:**
- *"Traição... betrayal..."*
- *"Paris... they wanted Paris..."*
- *"Silva... the name Silva..."* (James's last name)
- *"AMBOS... both of them..."*
- *"Amor... love killed me..."*

**Strategy:**
- Mix true hints with vague statements
- Let players INTERPRET (they'll argue about meaning)
- Don't make it TOO obvious

---

### **INTERROGATION (JC Leads - 3-4x During Act III)**

**Setup:**
- JC takes suspect to "corner" (private conversation area)
- Asks up to 5 questions
- Suspect can lie BUT if caught = loses credibility

**Your Role (GM):**

**If YOU'RE interrogated:**
- Answer as Helena (deflect, partial truths, emotional appeals)
- Don't confess yet (too early)

**If JAMES is interrogated (and you're watching):**
- Look nervous (you're worried he'll crack)
- Brief eye contact with him (silent support)

**If SOMEONE ELSE interrogated:**
- Stay in character, observe
- Mental notes (who's suspecting whom)

---

### **CONFRONTATION: Ines vs. Denise (1x During Act III)**

**Trigger:** When twin dynamics come up.

Denise: *"You were always the 'good one.' I was trash."*

Ines: *"I didn't ASK to be adopted! I didn't know!"*

**Your Role (GM):**

Let this play out (good drama).

**As Helena (character):** Look uncomfortable (family dysfunction reminds you of your own).

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### **PROBLEM: Players Lost/Not Finding Clues**

**SOLUTION A:** Drop Hint

Helena: [as GM] *"Has anyone checked behind the piano?"*

---

**SOLUTION B:** "Find" Clue Yourself

Helena: [as character] *"Wait, what's this?"* [pull out planted clue]

---

### **PROBLEM: Players Discover TOO EARLY (Accuse You Correctly at 21h30)**

**SOLUTION:** Deny Convincingly + Add Red Herrings

Helena: [as character] *"That's CIRCUMSTANTIAL! Yes, I led him to the office, but someone else could've—"*

[Then, as GM, reveal NEW red herring clue about someone else]

---

**SOLUTION B:** Lean Into It (Advanced)

Helena: [as character] *"You THINK you know. But do you have PROOF?"*

[Make them work for it - they need Tier 3 clues to be certain]

---

### **PROBLEM: Players Give Up / Too Hard**

**SOLUTION:** Extra Tier 2 Clue "Appears"

Helena: [as GM] *"Oh! I almost forgot. I found this earlier..."* [hand out crucial clue]

---

### **PROBLEM: Emilia (Cris) REALLY Upset (Real Emotions)**

**THIS IS SERIOUS.**

**SOLUTION:** Pause Game

Helena: [break character completely] *"Hey, let's take a 5-minute break. Everyone okay?"*

[Check in with Cris privately: "Are you okay? Do you need to step out?"]

**Remember:** Game is supposed to be FUN. If someone's genuinely distressed, PAUSE.

---

### **PROBLEM: Timing Running Over (Already 23h30, Not Done)**

**SOLUTION:** Speed Up Act V

- Shorter reconstruction (hit key points only)
- Skip some subplot resolutions
- Read letter faster
- Quick debrief

**It's okay to go over slightly, but don't let it drag to 1am.**

---

## 💭 FINAL THOUGHTS FOR YOU (HELENA THE PLAYER)

### **Remember:**

1. **It's a GAME.** If you mess up a line, improvise. Players won't know.

2. **Emotions are TOOLS.** Use real feelings (fear, guilt, love) to fuel performance.

3. **You're playing 3 roles.** Character, killer, GM. It's HARD. Be kind to yourself.

4. **Emilia's suicide is HEAVY.** Check in with Cris beforehand AND after. This moment is intense.

5. **The twist (inheritance letter) is TRAGIC.** Let yourself feel it. That devastation is REAL.

6. **Players will surprise you.** They'll find clues you didn't expect, make connections you didn't plan. EMBRACE IT. Improvise.

7. **You've prepared.** Trust your prep. Trust your instincts.

8. **This is YOUR game.** You created this. You're giving your friends an unforgettable experience.

### **You've Got This. 🎭**
