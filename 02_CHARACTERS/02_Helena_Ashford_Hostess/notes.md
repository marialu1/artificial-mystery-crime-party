## üí¨ Key Lines

**When accused of inheritance motive:**
> "We've been married fifteen years! [LIE - only 4] Every couple has life insurance. How DARE you suggest I'd kill for money!"

**If divorce letter found:**
> "What?! I... I had no idea he wanted to divorce me. I would have LET him if that's what he wanted!" [LIE]

**Final confession (if caught):**
> "Four years. Four years I lived with him. You saw the elegant parties. You didn't see him control every dollar, every friend, every BREATH. Then I met James... and felt alive. So yes. We killed him. For love. For freedom. Was it worth it? [looks at Emilia's empty chair] Ask me that again."
