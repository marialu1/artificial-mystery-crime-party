## ÔøΩ Git Hooks & Automation

### Pre-commit Hook
A git pre-commit hook automatically generates a fresh repository digest before each commit. This ensures the digest is always up-to-date.

**Installation:**
```bash
./install-hooks.sh
```

The hook runs `make ingest` automatically before every commit, keeping `digest.txt` current.

## ÔøΩüíæ Backup Strategy

- Keep original files in `10_ARCHIVE/old_versions/` before major changes
- Export important conversations to `10_ARCHIVE/conversation_exports/`
- Version control with git recommended
