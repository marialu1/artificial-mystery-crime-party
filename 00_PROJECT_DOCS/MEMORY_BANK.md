## üî™ THE CRIME - CORE NARRATIVE

### The Murder

**Victim:** Reginald "Reggie" Ashford III (48, textile magnate)  
**Date/Time:** December 24, 1926, 20h11-20h16  
**Location:** Office (moved to ballroom punch bowl)  
**Method:** Strangulation by piano wire  
**Staging:** Body placed in punch bowl with Christmas tree star inserted in head

### The Killers

**Primary:** James Harrods (Banker, 40)  
**Accomplice:** Helena Ashford (Hostess/Victim's Wife, 28)

### The Motives

**James Harrods:**
- Committed $15,000 stock fraud scheme
- Reggie scheduled denunciation for December 26th
- Facing 10+ years in prison
- Would lose career, reputation, freedom

**Helena Ashford:**
- 4 years of psychological abuse in marriage
- Reggie controlled: money, social life, friendships, movements
- Fell genuinely in love with James
- Divorce would leave her penniless (pre-nuptial control)

### The Central Twist: CRIME WAS UNNECESSARY

**Reggie's posthumous letter reveals:**
- Helena's grandmother Whitmore died in 1925
- Left Helena $80,000 inheritance (massive fortune in 1926)
- Reggie intercepted documents and hid them from Helena
- If she'd known, she could have divorced and lived freely
- **The murder was completely avoidable**

Greek tragedy level irony: They killed for freedom they already had.

### Secondary Tragedy: Emilia's Suicide

**Who:** Emilia Harrods (James's wife, mother of 2 children)  
**When:** Act IV (~80 minutes into game)  
**Method:** Drowns herself in Hudson River  
**Why:** Discovers husband's affair + murder conspiracy

**Impact:** 
- 2nd victim in cascade of tragedy
- James loses everything (lover arrested, wife dead, children orphaned)
- Helena's inheritance goes to Emilia by law... but Emilia's dead
- Money goes to STATE - nobody wins

### Thematic Core: "LOVE DESTROYS THREE WAYS"

| Character | Type of Love | Outcome |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Helena | Amor libertador (liberating love) | Kills to be free ‚Üí Prison |
| Emilia | Amor aprisionante (imprisoning love) | Loves too much ‚Üí Suicide |
| James | Amor desesperado (desperate love) | Kills for love ‚Üí Loses everything |

**Central Question:** *To what extremes will people go for love? And when does love become prison itself?*

## üí° KNOWN ISSUES & NOTES

### Minor Issues to Fix
1. **Date error in James Harrods notes** - needs correction before creating dossier
2. **Date error in Filipp Moretti notes** - needs correction before creating dossier
3. **Filipp's player unassigned** - currently marked as "???"

### Important Gameplay Notes
- **Confessional seal:** Padre Rui knows James intended murder but cannot reveal (realistic constraint)
- **Red herrings:** Daisy, Denise, and Filipp all have strong apparent motives
- **Clue tiers:** Progressive revelation system (9 initial ‚Üí 14 hidden ‚Üí 3 decisive)
- **Estimated solve rate:** 40-60% if players collaborate effectively
- **Emotional weight:** This is NOT a light puzzle game - heavy themes of abuse, suicide, tragedy

### Creative Decisions Made
- Ricardo plays dual role: victim before game starts, then butler during game (practical and dramatic)
- Emilia's suicide adds 2nd victim mid-game (escalates stakes)
- Final twist reveals crime was unnecessary (Greek tragedy irony)
- No clear winners - everyone loses something (karma distribution)
