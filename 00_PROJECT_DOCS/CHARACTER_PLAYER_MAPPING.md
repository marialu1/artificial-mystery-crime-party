## 📝 NAMING CONVENTIONS

### **In Game Documents (Character Dossiers, Scripts, Clues):**
✅ **ALWAYS use CHARACTER NAMES**
- "Daisy Valmont sang beautifully..."
- "Maria Fletcher took notes..."
- "James Harrods looked nervous..."

❌ **NEVER use player names in character documents**

### **In GM Materials:**
✅ Use character names with optional player notes
- "Daisy (Maria plays her) should receive..."
- "(Adriana's character) Maria Fletcher discovers..."

### **In Logistics/Admin:**
✅ Use player names for:
- Invitation envelopes
- Email communications
- Seating charts
- Dietary restrictions lists

---

## ⚠️ POTENTIAL CONFUSION POINTS

### **Two "Marias":**
1. **Maria (GM)** = Plays Helena Ashford
2. **Maria (player)** = Plays Daisy Valmont

**Solution:** In GM notes, refer to yourself as "GM" or "you" to avoid confusion.

### **Similar Names:**
- **Rui** (player) plays **Padre Rui Santos** (character) ✓ Same first name is fine
- **JC** (player) plays **JC Mendes** (character) ✓ Same abbreviation is fine
