## Issues & Resolutions

Track problems encountered and how they were solved:

### October 7, 2025 - Character Analysis: Date Inconsistencies Found

#### Error #1: James Harrods - Meeting Date
- **Problem:** Character document states "1 Dezembro 1926" as when James met Helena
- **Correct Date:** Should be "1 Dezembro 1925"
- **Evidence:** Helena's dossier confirms Dec 1, 1925; 1-year affair timeline (Dec 1925 - Dec 1926)
- **Impact:** Minor (narrative timeline still consistent)
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Documented, awaiting correction before dossier creation
- **Location:** User-provided document (not yet in repo files)

#### Error #2: Filipp Moretti - Piano Wire Acquisition Date
- **Problem:** Character document states "23 DEZEMBRO" for piano wire given to James
- **Correct Date:** Should be "21 DEZEMBRO"
- **Evidence:** Helena's dossier + James's document both confirm Dec 21
- **Impact:** Minor (doesn't affect gameplay)
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Documented, awaiting correction before dossier creation
- **Location:** User-provided document (not yet in repo files)

#### Error #3: JC Mendes - Dual Role Confusion
- **Problem:** Initial JC document included "PAPEL DUPLO" section (dual role)
- **Correct:** Only Ricardo has dual role (Reggie‚ÜíClarence), not JC
- **Solution:** ‚úÖ User provided corrected version removing dual role section
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
