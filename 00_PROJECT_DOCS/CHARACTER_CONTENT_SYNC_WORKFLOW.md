# Character Content Synchronization Workflow
## Automatic Rule for Updating Character Folders

**Created:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Active Rule  
**Purpose:** Ensure character folders stay synchronized with finalized content (PDFs, Canva designs, documents)

---

## üîÑ AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW RULE

### When User Provides Character Content:

**Trigger Conditions:**
- User shares a PDF, Canva design, or document with character information
- User uploads character booklet, dossier, or finalized content
- User provides updated character details in any format

**Automatic Action:**
1. **Analyze the content** (view with markitdown if PDF, read if text)
2. **Ask the user:**
   ```
   "I see you've provided [character name] content. 
   Would you like me to update the character folder 
   (02_CHARACTERS/XX_Character_Name/notes.md) 
   with this information?"
   ```
3. **If YES:** Update the character's `notes.md` file with:
   - All relationship details
   - Personality traits & mannerisms
   - Secrets (all layers)
   - Goals/objectives
   - Performance tips ("How to Play")
   - Any other relevant content
4. **Sync booklet location** in the notes (link to PDF in design assets)

## üéØ CONTENT SOURCES TO SYNC

### Priority 1 (Always Ask to Sync):
- ‚úÖ Canva-exported PDFs (character booklets)
- ‚úÖ User-provided character documents
- ‚úÖ Finalized player dossiers
- ‚úÖ Character sheet PDFs

## üîó CROSS-REFERENCING

When updating character folders, also check:

1. **MEMORY_BANK.md** - Ensure key facts align
2. **CHARACTER_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md** - Cross-reference relationships
3. **Other character notes** - Verify reciprocal relationships
4. **HELENA_COMPLETE_DOSSIER.md** - GM master guide consistency

---

## üìÇ FILE ORGANIZATION LINKS

After syncing content, ensure these links are correct in notes.md:

```markdown
**Full Analysis:** See `/00_PROJECT_DOCS/CHARACTER_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md`
**Player Pack:** `/03_UNIVERSAL_MATERIALS/player_packs/XX_Name_pack/`
**Canva Booklet:** `/09_DESIGN_ASSETS/character_booklets/XX_Name/`
**Booklet PDF:** `[path to actual PDF]`
```

---

## ‚úÖ SYNC CHECKLIST

When updating a character's notes.md:

```
‚ñ° All relationships copied with full descriptions
‚ñ° Personality traits & mannerisms included
‚ñ° All secret layers present (public ‚Üí private)
‚ñ° Goals/objectives clearly listed
‚ñ° "Did You Kill Him?" section complete

‚ñ° Italian phrases / accent notes (if applicable)

## üö® ERROR HANDLING

2. ‚úÖ Document correct date with source
3. ‚úÖ Mark as "‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS CORRECTION in [source]"
4. ‚úÖ Update CHANGELOG.md with error tracking

### If Content Conflicts with Existing Info:
1. üõë **STOP** - Don't auto-update
2. üì¢ **ASK USER:** "I found conflicting information. Which should I use?"
3. ‚úÖ Update after user clarifies
4. üìù Document decision in notes

---

## üìä TRACKING SYNCED CONTENT

### Status Indicators in notes.md:

```markdown
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE DOSSIER - Synced with Canva booklet
**Status:** üü° PARTIAL - Basic notes only
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SYNC - Canva version newer
**Status:** üî¥ NOT STARTED - Analysis only
```

---

## üé≠ CHARACTER-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### For Each Character, Preserve:
- **Unique voice/accent** (Italian for Filipp, spiritual for Emilia, etc.)
- **Key relationships** (with emotional context)
- **Layered secrets** (strategic reveal order)
- **Performance physicality** (gestures, mannerisms)
- **Signature phrases** (catchphrases, expressions)
- **Goals hierarchy** (primary vs secondary objectives)

## üîÑ WORKFLOW EXAMPLE (Filipp Moretti)

### What Happened (October 7, 2025):

1. **User uploaded:** `Ficha de Personagem Filipp (2).pdf` (8.8 MB Canva export)
2. **I analyzed:** Used markitdown tool to view content
3. **I asked:** "Update character folder with Canva content?"
4. **User confirmed:** "Yes - update AND create workflow rule"
5. **I updated:** `02_CHARACTERS/08_Filipp_Moretti_Entrepreneur/notes.md`
6. **Content synced:**
   - All 4 layered secrets (detailed)
   - 6 full relationships (Reggie, Daisy, James, Helena, John, Padre Rui)
   - Personality + mannerisms + Italian phrases
   - Performance tips ("How to Play")
   - Goals + "Did You Kill Him?" section
   - Booklet location reference
7. **Created:** This workflow rule document

**Result:** Character folder now mirrors Canva booklet exactly! ‚úÖ

## üìù COMMIT MESSAGES

When syncing character content, use commit format:

```

```

## üéØ FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

### Potential Enhancements:
- [ ] Automated cross-reference checker (verify reciprocal relationships)
- [ ] Version tracking (track multiple revisions of same character)
- [ ] Diff viewer (show what changed between syncs)
- [ ] Batch sync (update multiple characters at once)
- [ ] Export templates (generate notes.md from Canva structure)

---

## üìû QUICK REFERENCE

**This workflow ensures:**
1. Character folders = single source of truth
2. Canva booklets ‚Üî notes.md stay synchronized
3. No information lost between design and documentation
4. Easy player reference (one comprehensive notes.md file)
5. GM preparation simplified (all character info in one place)

**Active for:** All 11 characters  
**Next application:** When user provides content for other characters (JC, Helena, James, etc.)

*This is an active workflow rule. Any time character content is provided, this process triggers automatically.*
